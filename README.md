# Error Handling
Error Handling program in Solidity, which uses require, revert and Assert.

## Description

This program is written using Solidity-programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

The first line, it is the license for the code to be written. 

The second line is the version of this entity.

The third line, we have opened the contract called mod 1. Here we have declared two variables.

Next, we have a constructor for A and B to take input. Next, in error handling, we have three types. One is required, one is revert and one is assert.

In require, it takes two conditions. One is the condition and one is message.

The second is revert. , it flags the current error and it returns back the call. If there are extra gas used, the gas will be returned to the user's account.

Assert. Assert is same like required, but instead of two parameters, it takes only one parameter. And if the parameter is right, it executes next line.

You can check all this by compling in Remix Ide and deploying it individually.
